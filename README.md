#### Data set: 
The data and instructions details are involved in one Excel file.

2. Translate your findings in the previous step into actionable insights to increase performance in 2022. This data is presented on a nightly level.
3. Find attached a report generated on March 31, 2019, showing the performance of our competitive set of hotels, by day of the week. Compare the performance of our comp set.
